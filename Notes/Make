Create a makefile and put in commands
@ infront of commands 
removes printing the command. 

Rule name:
	Needs to have indentation

Execute through terminal by typing make "rulename"

To exec rule a before rule b: 

rule_a:
	echo "rule a"
rule_b: rule a
	echo "rule b"

How to make variables

TEXT = "42 is for the brave" // TEXT is a variable.

how to use: 

rule_a:
	echo $(TEXT)

with no parameter it prints first rule. 

Examples of Makefile:

NAME = awesomeprog

SRC = source.c // if need more line then use '\'

all: $(NAME)

$(NAME):
	gcc -o $(NAME) $(SRC)

clean:
	/bin/rm -f *.o

fclean: clean
	/bin/rm -f $(NAME)
